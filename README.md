# 📘 Advanced Text Classification – NLP Assignment 3  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is part of a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course assignment.  
The main objective is to build and evaluate models for **advanced text classification** using real-world textual datasets.  

The notebook explores:  
- Data preprocessing and text cleaning.  
- Vocabulary construction.  
- Feature extraction techniques (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, etc.).  
- Implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers.  
- Evaluation and comparison of results.
